RoboSchool is a workshop organized by the Technical University of Chemnitz, where high school students learn the basics of robot programming and electronics. The workshop aims to foster team spirit and cross-cultural friendships among the participants. This program was created and used by the team that won the second place at RoboSchool 2014. The task was to get a Pololu 3pi robot to follow a black line on the ground.
